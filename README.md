# Exploring Auxiliary Sensors and Algorithms for Autonomous Surface Vessel Positioning
Project thesis NTNU, December 2023

## Description
This repository contains all the code, documentation, and resources for our project thesis in collaboration with Maritime Robotics. Here, you'll find the algorithms and software developed for robust positioning of uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) in harbor environments, with a focus on sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras. This repo serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in maritime robotics, autonomous navigation, and sensor fusion technology.

## Code overview 
* Relative Positioning using Fiducial Markers
